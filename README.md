# UTMDigitalTour_TIS
Take a look inside UTM Digital, explore all its offices and different rooms

17.12.2024 - We embarked on an industry tour to UTM Digital to get a first hand experience on what it's like in an industry. This industry visit is aimed to provide students with a clearer vision on the reality of working in this industry as well as spark inspiration for new career paths. In total, roughly 150 computer science students attended this industry visit, which started with a talk on UTM Digital and its roles, an office tour as well as some demonstration on the facilities there
